        - Here we have written "PriortyQueue" as a class instead of queue because becuase as the name suggests it in itself is a queue with some priority given to a particular element.

        - Even if we replace "PriorityQueue" with "Queue" it would not throw any error.

        - We can use the functions of the queue interface.

        - Written to avoid confusion from the implementation of queue in Linked List.
