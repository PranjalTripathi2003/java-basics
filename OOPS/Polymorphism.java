/*
- The first letter of class names are capitalized to distinguish class names from member names. These conventions are not enforced by Java compilers, but it is considered bad style to violate them. A related convention is to never use the special character $ in a name; this character is reserved for the use of the Java compiler. Unfortunately, most Java compilers do not enforce this convention.

- Keep in mind that in Java, the main() method serves as the entry point for the program. It must be defined inside a class, and it's called automatically when you run the program. From the main() method, you can create objects of other classes and call their methods as needed.

- A Java class should have the same file name as of the main class.
- Only one "public" class can be inside a java file
- A empty class with no objects, does not take space in the memory. No memory allocated on runtime.

- "." operator is used for accessing either the BEHAVIOURS(int, string)  or PROPERTIES(functions/methods) both.

- Function called inside of a class is a METHOD.

- Java does not support methods within a method, i.e , we CANNOT HAVE NESTED METHODS! so dont try to write a method inside of the "main" method of the public java main class or simply the first class I have written in this code, we write it everytime the main class in case I FORGET THAT .
