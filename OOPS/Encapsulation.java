          // This is basically Encapsulation, that is to create a getter and setter for a private data member, here we have hidden the data to be accessed directly, in real world we would first authenticate and then "get" the private data member to be accessed.

        // Just like in a medicinal capsule , the medicine is inside of the capsule and not directly accessible , we access the actual method through ingesting the capsule, similarily a Java class with private function and data types could be accessed through getter and setter and not directly, ig that is the analogy. I could be wrong.
